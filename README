DESCRIPTION
    This module provide a Credit Card type based on Int. It will validate
    that the number passed to it appears to be a valid credit card number.
    Please note that this does not mean that the Credit Card is actually
    valid, only that it appears to be by algorithms defined in
    Business::CreditCard.

    The only type provided is "CreditCard".

    Enabling coerce will strip out any non "0-9" characters from a string
    allowing for numbers like "4111-1111-1111-1111" to be passed.
