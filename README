DESCRIPTION
    This module provides types related to Credit Cards for weak validation.

TYPES
    *   "CreditCard"

        Base Type: "Int"

        It will validate that the number passed to it appears to be a valid
        credit card number. Please note that this does not mean that the
        Credit Card is actually valid, only that it appears to be by
        algorithms defined in Business::CreditCard.

        Enabling coerce will strip out any non "0-9" characters from a
        string allowing for numbers like "4111-1111-1111-1111" to be passed.

    *   "CardSecurityCode"

        Base Type: "Int"

        A Credit Card Security Code
        <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_security_code> is a 3 or 4 digit
        number. This is also called CSC, CVV, CVC, and CID, depending on the
        issuing vendor.

SEE ALSO
    *   Business::CreditCard
