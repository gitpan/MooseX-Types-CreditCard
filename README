DESCRIPTION
    This module provides types related to Credit Cards for weak validation.

TYPES
  CardNumber
    Base Type: "Str"

    It will validate that the number passed to it appears to be a valid
    credit card number. Please note that this does not mean that the Credit
    Card is actually valid, only that it appears to be by algorithms defined
    in Business::CreditCard.

    Enabling coerce will strip out any non "0-9" characters from a string
    allowing for numbers like "4111-1111-1111-1111" to be passed.

  CardSecurityCode
    Base Type: "Str"

    A Credit Card Security Code
    <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_security_code> is a 3 or 4 digit number.
    This is also called CSC, CVV, CVC, and CID, depending on the issuing
    vendor.

  head2 CardExpiration
    Base Type: "DateTime"

    A Credit Card Expiration Date. It's a DateTime Object and checks to see
    if the object is equal to the last day of the month, using the month and
    year stored in the object.

    Coerce allows you to create the DateTime object from a "HashRef" by
    passing the keys "month" and "year".
